Welcome to PictureNamingTask's documentation!
===================================

**PictureNamingTask** 
This is task is a modernized version of a classic neuropsycholoigcal task known as a "picture naming task",where an individual is presented with a set of pictures of sheet of paper and asked to name each of them (The "Boston Naming Test"[1] being the most frequently used). The classic task is "fixed" in terms of the number of images and which images are shown. Classically, the number correct and the answer provided are recorded as a measurement. This expands on the classic version by allowing a user to add and remove stimuli as they deem necessary. Each stimulus also has a difficulty level associated with it. This allows for dynamic advancement and regression according to schedule set by the task administrator. 

The following pieces of data are recorded and downloaded in a .csv file at the end of session:


- Response time for stimulus screen
- Corresponding name of stimulus shown
- Corresponding correct/incorrect answer
- Corresponding response/notes logged by experimenter
- Corresponding difficulty level of the stimulus
